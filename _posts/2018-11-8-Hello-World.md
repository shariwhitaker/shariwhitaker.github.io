# Who am I ?
My name is Shari Whitaker. I am 16 years old. I am the oldest out of 6 kids.If you're the oldest you know that you have to look after your younger siblings and that they look up to you. So I try my best to do positive things so they can do positive things.I attend  ***Franklin D Roosevelt Collegiate Academy*** where I am currently a junior. If you're in the collegiate academy at Roosevelt you take classes at ***El Centro Community College***.The purpose of that is to work towards getting an associate degree by the time you graduate. In that case I am working towards my associates degree in information technology and should have it by the year 2020.I consider myself to be kind of anti-social.I love being by myself because that's when I'm at peace the most. Peace is super important for me being that I have a lot going on right now far as school. I am the girl who get frustrated easily with people and things but move forward anyway. I'm the girl who can't give up because giving up is the for the weak plus how would that look to my younger siblings if I give up because I got frustrated.I'm the type of person that doesn't talk about their problems but instead just hold it in because not everyone needs to know how I feel. I would consider myself mean but I also am sweet.I love giving to the homeless and helping others out if I can. It make me feel good when I do and I believe that is how you get your blessings.So yeah that's me the mean,anti-social but yet sweet and smart girl.

# What am I doing here ?
>What am I doing here ? That's a good question because I'm not even sure. I could make up a lie well it wouldn't be a total like but it's partially the truth.I am here to get my associates degree (this the truth lol).I wasn't forced to join the program but I honestly don't that this is the best program for me. Don't get me wrong it's an excellent program it's just so boring it's not something that i want to do with my life in the future. People say its boring because it's just the beginning but I don't think that's it. When I first received the opportunity to earn my associates degree while in high school it wasn't at Roosevelt. It was at ***Kathlyn Joy Gilliam*** and their program is different because it isn't where you choose pathways. You simply take all the basic courses to be considered as a junior when attending a 4 year university. I should have stayed but I thought "it was too hard". I made a big mistake because nothing in life will ever be easy.So the real reason I am here it to get hours that can transfer over to a 4 year university because not all my hours will transfer since I am not going into the same field .

# Where will I take this experience?
I most likely will get a part-time job in this field but that's just temporary.I might do a side business and create web pages for people for a small fee. Although i said I didn't want career in this field I will only start off in this career to get a taste of this. I don't want to do the same thing for the rest of my life. Outside of that I'm not sure what I will do besides share my experience with other kids to encourage them to join the programs. I will only tell them about the positive though . I might actually just give them the downfalls of it too because maybe they wont see it as a down fall.

# What do I want to be ?
I want to be an orthopedic surgeon. They make so much money and the type of lifestyle that  I want to have I need that money. They work with the musculoskeletal system. I think that is pretty exciting. I just don't want to be in school that long . I don't know if I have what it takes to get accepted into medical school to even make this career a reality. I most likely will change this when I enter college because ain't that what most people do ? I used to want to be a teacher for as long as I could remember then I changed my mind about that my freshman year. I had come to the conclusion that my temper and patience would not allow me to pursue that job.
